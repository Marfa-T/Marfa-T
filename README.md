Here I am,

I'm a non-practising chemist (trust me) who has been managing research projects within a 2nd tier charity the past 6 years.
I took the opportunity of voluntary redundancy last year and am excellent with data, telling stories and showing why the listener should care.
I'm learning to code properly as I want to be able to work with large datasets, drawing out insight and meaning.

This is what I've done so far, I like to think that it's a poor example of what I could do, for now anyway. I'm only on task 5...
