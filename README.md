Hello there,

I'm a non-practicing chemist who has been analysing data and managing research projects for the past 6 years in a 2nd tier charity organisation.
I took the opportunity of voluntary redundancy last year and am now learning to code in Python.
I am excellent analysing data, drawing out meaning and creating narrative to share the findings.

This is what I've created so far, I'm hoping it's a poor reflection of what I could do - I'm only on task 5...
